# TODOs
- [ ] Add validation error ensuring all "faces" are unique per deck
- [ ] Do not show answers which are same (eg same kana for a kanji)
- [ ] Refresh on resize
- [ ] Ability to close
- [ ] Show stats at end (%/# correct/incorrect, etc)
- [ ] Light mode/dark mode/contrast
- [ ] Additional mode: "flash" - Very basic flashcard mode with spacebar flipping between faces, and right/left with a progress bar.
    - MVP mode should be called "match"
- [ ] Additional mode: "type" - Show a face and then ask user to type the response. Cannot (easily) ask for definition without refactoring definitions
- [ ] Additional mode: "mixed" - Random mix of all modes
- [ ] Repeat missed problems at end
- [ ] Track missed problems, and retry them (like duolingo, stretch goal)
- [x] Show all face information at end (maybe only if missed)?
- [x] Deck "faces", to describe which face is which (to support hiragana only + kanji decks together)
    - [x] Add "faces" Vec instead of "face_count"
    - [x] Create tests based on what the faces "are". Eg, match Kanji with other Kanji and Hiragana with other Hiragana, but based on faces rather than face index
    - [x] Check to ensure each card face has at least 3 (or number of other answers) other cards with non-equal faces
        - [ ] Tested
